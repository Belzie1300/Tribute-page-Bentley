        <h3>Here's a timeline of Bentley W. Hergstrom's life:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>2008</strong> - Born in Melbourne, an English Pointer</li>
          <li>
            <strong>2011</strong> - Leaves his first family home in the suburbia
            due to being a destructive puppy and found new home on acreage.
            There, he became besties with Lilman the Bloodhound and Tilly the
            Stagehound
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2012</strong> - The Trio would stay together, take naps
            together, egg each other on and get into mischief but there was
            never any quarrels between them. Bentley was found to be a picky
            eater, knows what he likes and likes to keep clean.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2013</strong> - Enjoying life to the fullest, he would have
            the whole acreage to explore multiple times a day. Being surrounded
            but lots of bird life and trees, he will stalk them and have his
            famous trait of the breed 'pointing' staring quietly at his preys
            but never really catch anything
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2015</strong> - He was caught in action of climbing the
            wired fence to our neighbour. Although he loves his 5 acres
            territory, to him, it was not enough and was found wondering in the
            neighboring 5 acres multiple times, it became his favourite pastime
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2016</strong> - Athena the rescued bloodhound joined the
            family, who unfortunately came from a traumatic upbringing. Although
            she did not get along with Lilman and Tilly out of jealousy but
            strangely found comfort being around Bentley
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2017</strong> - Bentley will always get along with other
            dogs of different sizes who would come to stay for a period
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2019</strong> - With the family being hectic with 4 big
            dogs, Bentley being a fence climber, he evidently spends most of his
            time with the neighbour of an older couple who welcomes Bentley with
            love. So much so, the neighbour took him in as their own, where he
            found his forever home and was given the middle name "Windsor" to
            add to his gentlemen's demeanor
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2020</strong> - Bentley would always come back over for
            occassional visits for cuddles, sometimes steal chicken eggs from us
            and would gladly trott back to his "other" loving family. As he got
            a bit older and not as agile as he once were, they installed a green
            push-pull gate with a ramp for Bentley to easily access both
            properties
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2021</strong> - With Lilman and Tilly passed, Eva the
            bloodhound puppy was welcomed to the family and Bentley would come
            over to greet the new pup and deal with her boisterous behaviour
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2023</strong> - To this day, Bentley is still going strong
            but does not visit as often due to arthritis in his back legs.
            However, he would visit the fence line for pats
          </li>
